        <h3>About Our Farm</h3>
        <p>For over 15 years, we've been raising livestock the way it should be done - with plenty of space, good feed, and patience. Our cattle and sheep graze on open pastures here in Egypt,<br>where we can keep an eye on every animal and ensure they're healthy and well-cared for.</p>
        <p>We started this farm because we believe families deserve to know where their meat comes from. When you order from us, you're getting livestock raised naturally, without shortcuts.<br> Whether you need a whole animal or select cuts, we handle everything from raising to delivery.</p>

        <h3>What We Offer</h3>
        <p>We specialize in grass-fed cattle and pasture-raised sheep. Each animal is raised on our farm from birth, so we can guarantee the quality. You can browse available livestock, place your order<br>online, and schedule delivery or farm pickup at your convenience.</p>
